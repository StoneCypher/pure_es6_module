# pure_es6_module
This is how I currently make pure ES6 modules which can also be consumed in ES5 environments. 

Contains:
  - `babel` for transpilation 
  - `flowtype` (optional) for type enforcement
  - `react` for react
  - `ava.js` and `ava-spec` for testing
  - `documentation.js` for documentation extraction
  - `browserify` for bundling
